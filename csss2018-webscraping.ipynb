    "[Data scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) is a method for extracting data from the web. There are many techniques which can be used for web scraping — ranging from requiring human involvement (“human copy-paste”) to fully automated systems (using computer vision). Somewhere in the middle is HTML parsing, which we will describe here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping using [HTML parsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping#HTML_parsing) is often used on webpages which share similar HTML structure. For example, you might want to scrape the ingredients from chocolate chip cookie recipes to identify correlations between ingredients and five-star worthy cookies, or you might want to predict who will win March Madness by looking at game play-by-plays, or you want to know all the local pets up for adoption."
